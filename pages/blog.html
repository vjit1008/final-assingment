          <p>Who needs a gym when there’s the living room floor?</p>
          <p>Bodyweight exercises are simple, effective ways to improve balance, flexibility, and strength without gym machines or equipment. You can do all these bodyweight exercises at home.</p>
          <p>From legs and shoulders to chest and abs, we’ve covered every part of your body that can get stronger with body resistance alone.</p>
          <p>We’ve also provided some basic bodyweight exercises for beginners and compared bodyweight workout results to those of weighted, gym, and cardio routines.</p>

          <h3 id="introduction">What is a bodyweight workout?</h3>
          <p>Bodyweight workouts are exercise routines that use a person’s own bodyweight to create resistance and improve strength, flexibility, and endurance, as well as coordination.</p>
          <p>You’ve probably done a push-up before — well done. You’ve already met bodyweight exercises. On occasion, you can use a wand or resistance band to support an exercise.</p>
          <p>While there are bodyweight exercises you can do in a gym (pull-ups, anyone?), having a calisthenics or plyometrics routine means you can stay in shape without the need for a gym membership or expensive equipment.</p>
          <h3 id="benefits">Benefits of bodyweight exercises</h3>
          <p>You might be thinking, why not go to the gym? If you’re paying all that money, it must be better than simply using your own bodyweight.</p>
          <p>But here’s why bodyweight exercises can make all the difference to your routine:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>
              They’re efficient. 
            </strong>
              You can get impressive results from short workouts alone, and they can work alongside other types of exercises to boost performance.</li>
              <li><strong>
                They’re both strength and cardio. 
              </strong>
              Keep your heart pumping while building muscle and flexibility.</li>

              <li><strong>
                They’re crazy good for burning fat. 
              </strong>
              The burn continues looooong after the workout. For example, one study found that a 45-minute workout increases how fast your body burns fat for 14 hours.</li>

              <li><strong>
                You can switch up with ease.
              </strong>
              No wiping down and changing machines, and no restrictions on how to exercise based on your ability level. You’re unlikely to get bored during a bodyweight workout — the challenge stays.</li>

              <li><strong>
                You have zero excuses not to exercise.
              </strong>
              In the immortal words of Shakira: Whenever. Wherever. You don’t need to be in a gym — you just need enough space to move around a bit.</li>

              <li><strong>
                They’re free.
              </strong>
              ‘Nuff said.</li>

              <li><strong>
                The results.
              </strong>
              Bodyweight exercises may help you get results. They use compound movements that engage several joints and muscles with each move. This makes exercises like push-ups and lunges super effective for improved strength and performance.</li>
          </ul>

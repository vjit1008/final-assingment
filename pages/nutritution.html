          <h2>Changing Your Diet: Choosing Nutrient-rich Foods</h2>
          <img src="./assets/carbohydrates.jpg" alt="" />

          <p class="start-para">
            Choose a diet made of nutrient-rich foods. Nutrient-rich (or
            nutrient-dense) foods are low in sugar, sodium, starches, and bad
            fats. They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals and few calories.
            Your body needs vitamins and minerals, known as micronutrients. They
            nourish your body and help keep you healthy. They can reduce your
            risk for chronic diseases. Getting them through food ensures your
            body can absorb them properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to eat a variety of foods to get different vitamins and
            minerals. Foods that naturally are nutrient-rich include fruits and
            vegetables. Lean meats, fish, whole grains, dairy, legumes, nuts,
            and seeds also are high in nutrients.
          </p>

          <h3>Path to improved health</h3>
          <p>
            You may not get all the micronutrients your body needs. Americans
            tend to eat foods that are high in calories and low in
            micronutrients. These foods often also contain added sugar, sodium
            (salt), and saturated or trans fats. This type of diet contributes
            to weight gain. It can increase your risk of health issues, such as
            type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), American
            adults may not get enough of the following micronutrients.

          <h3>Grains</h3>
          <p>
            Whole-grain foods are low in fat. They’re also high in fiber and
            complex carbohydrates. This helps you feel full longer and prevents
            overeating. Check the ingredient list for the word “whole.” For
            example, “whole wheat flour” or “whole oat flour.” Look for products
            that have at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. Some enriched
            flours have fiber but are not nutrient-rich.
          </p>
          <p>Choose these foods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rolled or steel cut oats</li>
            <li>Whole-wheat pasta</li>
            <li>Whole-wheat tortillas</li>
            <li>Whole-grain (wheat or rye) crackers, breads, and rolls</li>
            <li>Brown or wild rice</li>
            <li>Barley, quinoa, buckwheat, whole corn, and cracked wheat</li>
          </ul>
